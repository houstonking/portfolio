# Portfolio
A brief overview of who I am and a little bit of work I've done. A bit thin for now, but, it will get fleshed out in time. 


# Repositories
It is still *very* work-in-progress, but I started writing a library to perform generalized constraint-based inference over arbitrary semirings.  If I were to start work on a PhD, it would be my hope to advance the state of the art in this area. I find the strong unification of disparate algorithms (such as Bayesian inference, constraint satisfaction, and decision making) via the lens of abstract algebra to be very exciting. Additionally, I think it wound be fun to leverage the specific properties of the semiring of interest (say, commutativity) for automatic optimizations such as parallelization.
